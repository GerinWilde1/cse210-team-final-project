## Purpose
This is a game build as an exercise to leard Classes and Object-Oriented Programming.
Through the program we are able to practice and apply the 4 pillers of OOP

Abstraction - simplify the actions taken in with the code.
  Like the start up menu, there's no need to know everything that's going on in order to start the game. Just click "Start."
Encapsulation - Making sure everything has access to the information they need and do not have access to what they don't.
  While the players sprite needs no have access to it's specific picture, nothing else does.
Inheritance - Using a Parent/Child relation between objects in order to eliminate redundant code.
  Everything flys, There's no need to program that into every class or object. 
Polymorphism - Changing Inheritance to fit the needs of specific classes and objects.
  While everything flys, not everything flys the same way or at the same speed. Changed need to be made in order to allow for this.
